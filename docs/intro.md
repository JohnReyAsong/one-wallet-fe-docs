# Onewallet Frontend

## Getting Started

Onewallet Frontend is composed of **three sites:**

**[Back Office](https://admin.nexiux.io/signin)**

In here, we can control the overall content of the website. We can also view dashboard, reports, add/edit member information, geofencing, permissions, etc.

**[Superadmin / Control Center](https://admin.nexiux.io/controlcenter/signin)**

This is the control center wherein higher level content is being interacted with. You can create several brand configurations here.

**[Web Responsive](http://web-staging.aonewallet.com/)**

This is the user facing website where users can play games, withdraw and deposit money, etc.
